\blackbtn{MIDI B MODE} \btn{MIDI OUT} \btn{MIDI THRU} \btn{MIDI OUT + THRU}

\section{CV/pedal}

\blackbtn{CV IN 2V NOTE} \btn{C1♯} \btn{...} \btn{F4♯}

Selects the CV INPUT TO MIDI root note. By default, a CV voltage of 2V plays a C2 MIDI note on the current track.

\blackbtn{CV IN TYPE} \btn{VOLT/OCTAVE} \btn{HERTZ/VOLT}

Selects if your analog controller generates CV V/oct or CV Hz/V.

\blackbtn{CV OUT 2V NOTE} \btn{C1♯} \btn{...} \btn{F4♯}

Selects the MIDI TO CV OUTPUT root note. By default, a C2 MIDI note plays a CV voltage of 2V.

\blackbtn{CV OUT TYPE} \btn{VOLT/OCTAVE} \btn{HERTZ/VOLT}

Selects if your analog synthesizer is controlled by CV V/oct or CV Hz/V.

\blackbtn{GATE POLARITY} \btn{ACTIVE 5V} \btn{ACTIVE 0V}

Selects the active polarity gate of your analog synthesizer.

\blackbtn{ASSIGN ENV OUT TO} \btn{VELOCITY} \btn{PITCH} \btn{AFTERTOUCH} \btn{MODULATION} \btn{DIN SYNC}

Selects if the CV ENV outputs the note velocity, the pitch, the aftertouch (channel pressure) or the modulation of the CV track. You can also assign the CV ENV output to the din sync clock, to easily sync your modular system with a mini jack.

\blackbtn{DIN SYNC} \btn{OFF} \btn{SYNC1} \btn{SYNC2} \btn{SYNC4} \btn{SYNC8} \btn{SYNC12} \btn{SYNC16} \btn{SYNC24} \btn{SYNC48} \btn{SYNC96}

Selects the DIN SYNC clock speed.

\blackbtn{SEND DIN SYNC} \btn{PLAY ONLY} \btn{ALWAYS}

The DIN SYNC clock can be sent only when the player is playing, or always (when player is stopped or played).

\blackbtn{ASSIGN PEDAL HOT TO} \btn{RECORD} \btn{PLAY/PAUSE} \btn{PLAY/STOP}

Sets the action that will be triggered by the footswitch pedal.

\blackbtn{ASSIGN PEDAL COLD TO} \btn{RECORD} \btn{PLAY/PAUSE} \btn{PLAY/STOP}

Sets the action that will be triggered by the footswitch pedal (if double pedal used).


\section{Misc}

\blackbtn{DOUBLE TAP MODE} \btn{VELOCITY} \btn{GLIDE}

In NOTE and CHORD stepmodes, double tap a pad to enter velocity accents or gliding notes. Glides only works with compatible synths: if two notes follow, the first one need to be double tapped to create a glide between these two notes.

\blackbtn{REC COUNTDOWN} \btn{OFF} \btn{1 BAR} \btn{2 BAR} \btn{3 BAR} \btn{4 BAR}

Activates a countdown before a recording in live mode (When the player is stopped and you press REC then PLAY). You can select the duration of the countdown. The countdown will be send on the same metronome output channel and note.

\blackbtn{METRONOME} CH \btn{OFF} \btn{CURRENT TRACK} \btn{MIDI CH01A} \btn{...} \btn{USB CH16}

Select the metronome output channel (made with MIDI notes). If the metronome is activated (2ND+REC), the metronome will be send on this selected track, and will follow the beat.

\blackbtn{METRONOME NOTE} \btn{C-1} \btn{G9}

Select the metronome output note. If the metronome is activated (2ND+REC), the metronome will click on the selected note.

\blackbtn{CC ASSIGN} \btn{AUTOREC OFF} \btn{AUTOREC ON}

With autorec on, as soon as you assign a CC control and move it to set the value, an automation message is created to store this value (you can display it or remove it in stepmode CC MESSAGES). This message will be sent at the start of the track, so your synthesizer will always have the right set value.

\blackbtn{PLAY/PAUSE PAD} \btn{PAUSE/CONTINUE} \btn{RESTART}

If play/pause selected, a press on the PLAY pad will alternately play and pause the playback. If restart selected, a press on the PLAY pad will always restart the current sequence playback from the beginning. It's an other way to play with sequences.

\blackbtn{DEFAULT TRACK} \btn{MODE FREE} \btn{MODE RELATCH} \btn{MODE TRIG}

Define the default zoom of all tracks at startup.

\blackbtn{DEFAULT LENGTH} \btn{1 BAR} \btn{\ldots} \btn{64 BAR}

Define the default length of all tracks at startup.

\blackbtn{DEFAULT TS L} \btn{1/} \btn{\ldots} \btn{24/}

Define the default time signature left number of all tracks at startup.

\blackbtn{DEFAULT TS R} \btn{/1} \btn{\ldots} \btn{/16}

Define the default time signature right number of all tracks at startup.

\blackbtn{DEFAULT PERFORM} \btn{INST} \btn{BEAT} \btn{1 BAR} \btn{\ldots} \btn{8 BAR}

Set the default run mode of new tracks.

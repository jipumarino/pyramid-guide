TODO

- Buttons
  - Button minimum width, like single numbers (p.32)

- Refactor
  - Fit two/grid/etc graphics is awesomely brittle
  - Change fit*graphics to fitgraphics with optional argument
  - Consolidate *icon *btn commands
  - Find a way to remove empty arguments {} (xspace?)
  - Investigate possible titlespacing/titleformat overlap
  - Format newcommands in multiple lines (probably with line-ending comments)

- Documentation
  - Comments in config section
